# Web Infrastructure Design Project

This project focuses on designing various web infrastructure setups for hosting a website called www.foobar.com. The designs include simple setups as well as more complex and secured setups. Each setup is whiteboarded and explained according to specific requirements.

## Tasks Overview

The project consists of several tasks, each requiring the design of a different web infrastructure setup:

1. **Simple Web Stack**: Design a basic web infrastructure with a single server hosting the website using a LAMP stack.
2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**: Design a more complex infrastructure with multiple servers, a load balancer, and database replication.
3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**: Design a secure and monitored infrastructure with firewalls, SSL encryption, and monitoring clients.
4. **Scale Up**: Further scale up the infrastructure by splitting components across multiple servers and adding load balancers.

## Requirements

Each task has specific requirements for the infrastructure design, including the use of certain components and the ability to explain various aspects of the setup. These requirements are outlined in detail within each task's description.
